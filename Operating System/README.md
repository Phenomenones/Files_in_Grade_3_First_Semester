# The Labs and Paper Report of Operating System
The labs and paper report of Operating System.  
The labs are the same with [MIT 6.828](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/labguide.html) with a few simplifications.  
The paper report is from [FAST17](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast17/technical-sessions/presentation/li), which is about filesystem.
